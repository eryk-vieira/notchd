//! What a module that lives in the daemon is (docs/modules.md, "A module in
//! the daemon"): state in, facts and view trees out. The daemon (`corehost`)
//! owns the clock, the config and the providers and calls it; a module never
//! reads the time or the system itself, so each is tested as a plain value.
//!
//! Every call that can change something (`config`, `tick`, `event`,
//! `command`, `feed`) is followed by the host asking `facts`, `view` per slot
//! and `take_effects`; the host sends the UIs only what changed.
