# Development

Working on notchd itself. For using it, see the [README](README.md); for the rules that must not break, [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Package (Arch) | For |
|---|---|---|
| Rust toolchain | `rustup` (or `mise`) | the daemon, `make daemon`, `make rust`, `make test`, and so `make dev`, `make restart` and every QML and visual layer (they build it). `native/rust-toolchain.toml` pins the version (with rustfmt and clippy); rustup installs it on first use, or `mise use rust@<that version>` |
| Quickshell | `quickshell` | running the notch, `make dev`, `make visual` |
| Qt 6 `qmllint` | `qt6-declarative` | `make lint` |
| Node.js 18+ | `nodejs` | `make test` (built-in `node:test`, no dependencies): the UI-side JS and the shared vectors |
| ImageMagick, python-dbus, python-gobject | `imagemagick`, `python-dbus`, `python-gobject` | `make visual`, `make hero` (the demo media player) |
| JetBrainsMono Nerd Font | `ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd` | `make hero` |
| `rsvg-convert` | `librsvg` | `make icons` |
| Omarchy 4 | | the Omarchy host, `make validate`, `make restart` |
| `zig` 0.15.2 | (downloaded by `scripts/fetch-zig.sh`) | building the daemon's terminal emulator (Ghostty's libghostty-vt); `make` fetches it into `build/zig` |
| `git` | `git` | the same build fetches Ghostty's source at a pinned commit |
| `curl` | `curl` | the daemon's plan-usage requests (tests use a fake network) |
| GNOME Shell (optional) | `gnome-shell`, `mutter-devkit`, `python-gobject`; `podman` for GNOME 46 | the GNOME extension (`hosts/gnome/`): `make gnome-dev`, `make gnome-test`, and the `-46` ones. Not needed for `make check`; your session stays what it is |

## Layout

notchd is a Rust daemon plus a UI per OS. The daemon decides everything (config, settings schema, notch state, every module); the Linux UI is QML on Quickshell and only binds the daemon's state and draws. [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) is the contract between them.

```
manifest.json         Omarchy plugin manifest: the repo root is the plugin
shell.qml             standalone host: the repo root is also a Quickshell config
native/               the daemon (Rust workspace; Cargo.toml, rust-toolchain.toml, releases.json)
  notchd-proto/       the wire: every message and view primitive as serde types, JSON Schema (schema/), limits
  notchd-core/        the rules, no I/O: config, settings schema, notch state, peek, navigation, timers,
                      usage, agent titles rules; the spatial order and creation rule
                      (`spatial.rs`); a `store` that holds the whole state
  notchd-modules/     the built-in modules (media, timer, activities, resources, osd, claude, codex,
                      terminals) as `CoreModule`s: state in, facts, view trees and effects out
  notchd-providers/   what the OS gives: media (MPRIS), /proc, PTYs, plan usage; `linux/` backends
  notchd-daemon/      the `notchd` binary: server, router, hub, module host for user modules (modhost/),
                      PTY sessions, the CLI (`notchd ipc`, `notchd attach`, `notchd daemon --ensure`)
  notchd-testkit/     a fake UI, a fake module process, temp dirs, the golden loader
  releases.json       the daemon releases the plugin may download, with SHA-256s (empty until the first)
core/                 the Linux UI: no desktop-specific code
  client/             DaemonClient.qml (the socket), DaemonLauncher.qml, Protocol.js, ViewTree.qml and prims/
                      (one file per view primitive)
  NotchService.qml    binds the daemon's config, schema and state; reports screens and the modules it loads;
                      the QML side of IPC; owns no rules
  CoreModule.qml      a module that lives in the daemon (every built-in one, user modules): draws its views
  DaemonDown*.qml     "notchd not running": the row, and its window while the daemon is away
  Notch.qml           one notch of the state: its modules, place and copies
  NotchCopy.qml       a notch on one screen: sends the pointer, binds mode, pin, peek; the drag's motion
  NotchSurface.qml    a window per copy, and the space they reserve
  NotchWindow.qml     the layer-shell overlay that puts one copy on screen
  NotchCard.qml       the notch itself: outline, padding, the current view
  NotchModule.qml     base type of a module the QML loads itself (tests, a host's own)
  Theme.qml           visual tokens (singleton), fed by the host
  Position.js         pixel geometry: where the notch sits, corners and joined rows (pure JS, golden vectors)
  Outline.js          the notch's outline: shoulders, corners, joins (pure JS, golden vectors)
  Config.js           the optimistic copy of a config edit, the notch list (the daemon's answer replaces it)
  Terminal.js         the key that leaves a terminal
  terminal/           GhosttySurface.qml: a terminal, drawn from the screen the daemon emulates
                      (its own connection to the daemon; keys, pointer and clipboard go back)
  modules/            claude.svg, the mark the UI bundles (each built-in module's JSON file is in
                      native/notchd-modules/modules/: the daemon's modules have no QML)
  DepthReport.qml     what a notch card measures of itself, sent to the daemon (`measure`)
  KeepShown.qml       shows a window again after its monitor goes away and comes back
  *Compositor.qml     compositor adapters (Hyprland, generic)
  settings/           the settings window, its controls and Settings.js (control mechanics)

```

**Where a thing goes.** A rule (what shows, which peek wins, how a config edit works, a module's behaviour) goes in `native/`, never in QML. QML is for what only the UI knows: windows, pixels, the drag's motion, animation, theme mapping. A new built-in module is a Rust file in `notchd-modules` ([docs/modules.md](docs/modules.md#a-module-in-the-daemon) says how); a module of your own is a folder of `~/.config/notchd/modules/` ([User modules](docs/modules.md#user-modules)).

## Running it

### Omarchy host

The plugin folder is a symlink to the checkout:

```sh
ln -sfn "$PWD" ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/eryk.notchd
make restart                 # build the daemon, then omarchy restart shell
```

The shell does not hot-reload plugin QML: run `make restart` after changing it. It builds the daemon (`make daemon`, a release build) and compares it with `$XDG_DATA_HOME/notchd/bin/notchd`: unchanged, the running daemon stays (its terminal and agent sessions with it); changed, it stops the daemon, installs the new build and the shell starts it. Config changes apply live. How the plugin gets enabled, and the stock OSD it replaces, are in [hosts/omarchy](hosts/omarchy/README.md).

Building the daemon builds Ghostty's libghostty-vt (its terminal emulator) from source, which needs zig 0.15.2 (Arch's `zig` is newer than Ghostty accepts) and git: every `make` target that runs cargo puts `scripts/fetch-zig.sh`'s zig first on `PATH` (downloaded once into `build/zig`, its SHA-256 checked). Running cargo by hand: `PATH="$(scripts/fetch-zig.sh):$PATH" cargo ...`.

The shell's log:

```sh
qs log --pid "$(pgrep -xf 'quickshell -n -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell')" | grep -i notchd
```

### Standalone host

```sh
make dev                     # config in build/dev-config.json, never ~/.config
qs -p . ipc call notchd settings
```

`make dev` builds the daemon and runs it as its own `dev` instance (`NOTCHD_INSTANCE`, the dev config), never the `default` one a real shell uses; a dev daemon of an earlier build is stopped first, since the daemon outlives the shell. It hot-reloads on every QML change, core included (a Rust change needs `make dev` again). Next to the Omarchy host it draws a second notch, on IPC target `notchd`. The daemon's own commands: `native/target/release/notchd ipc <method>`, `notchd attach term:<id>`; with `NOTCHD_INSTANCE=dev NOTCHD_CONFIG=build/dev-config.json` they reach the dev instance.

The GNOME extension (`hosts/gnome/`, work in progress: docs/architecture.md, "GNOME UI") runs in a GNOME session inside a window of your desktop, whatever it is:

```sh
make gnome-dev                # gnome-shell --devkit, its own daemon, config, D-Bus and runtime dir
make gnome-test               # the extension in a headless GNOME Shell, two monitors, the real daemon
make gnome-zip                # build/gnome-ext/: the folder and the zip for extensions.gnome.org
make gnome-dev-46             # GNOME 46 (Ubuntu 24.04) from a podman image, in an X11 window (Xwayland)
make gnome-test-46            # the headless tests on GNOME 46, in that image
```

`make gnome-dev` prints the session's socket: `NOTCHD_SOCKET=<it> native/target/release/notchd ipc push '{...}'` drives its daemon. The dev sessions force animations on and show a demo user module, `tests/gnome/modules/primitives`, with the primitives the built-in modules only draw with a player or a microphone (image, equalizer, meter, list); its logs stay in the session's scratch dir. Extensions do not hot-reload: close the window and run it again. `scripts/gnome-build.sh` assembles the extension, copying the UI-side `core/` files into `lib/` as ES modules.

## The gate

The tests are a pyramid: many cheap ones at the bottom, few costly ones on top, and the costly ones run less often. While you work, run `make test` after every change (seconds) and the layer that covers what you touched; run `make check`, every layer, before every commit.

| Layer | Target | What it does | Run it |
|---|---|---|---|
| unit | `make test` | Node tests of the UI-side JS (`core/*.js`, `core/settings/*.js`, the client) and the shared vectors; the Python rules of the scripts as functions (`tests/*_test.py`, every TestCase without `tier = "integration"`); `cargo test` over the workspace (the rules and modules as values, the daemon over a real socket on a temp dir, with a fake UI). No processes of the user's, no servers | after every change |
| rust | `make rust` | `cargo fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings` and `cargo test --workspace` over `native/`. `make test` runs the same `cargo test`; `make rust` adds the format check and clippy, which `make check` needs | after a change to `native/` |
| integration | `make integration` (builds the daemon) | `tests/fetch_daemon_test.py`, `scripts/fetch-daemon.py` and `scripts/ensure-daemon.sh` against a local release server; `tests/mpris_test.py`, the real daemon against the demo player on a private D-Bus (`make integration` builds the daemon first). On parallel workers, each in its own process group, killed with what it left behind (every process is also under `timeout -k`) | after a change to `scripts/fetch-daemon.py` or `scripts/ensure-daemon.sh` |
| qml | `make qmltest` (builds the daemon) | the QML behaviour tests, in parallel shards (below) | after a QML change |
| visual | `make visual` | renders the settings window and the notch on each edge (the real modules, the media one playing the demo player's track) offscreen into `build/visual/`; fails on any QML warning, so it also proves the core loads | after a visual change, and look at the PNGs |
| static | `make lint` | `qmllint` over `shell.qml` and the core; fails on any warning | after a QML change |
| static | `make validate` | `omarchy plugin validate .` | before a commit |

`make check` runs lint, validate, the unit layer and `make rust` first, one after another, so a broken rule fails in seconds; then integration, qml and visual at once. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `make rust`, `make test` and `make integration`; the QML layers need Quickshell and stay local.

**What it costs.** Every layer records its wall-clock and CPU time, and each test's seconds, in `build/times/`. `make times` prints the pyramid from the last run of each layer: tests, wall and CPU per layer, the slowest tests, and those over their layer's budget (0.1 s for a Node or Python unit test, which is what the report lists per test; the Rust layers are timed as a whole: one that takes longer is not a unit test, make it cheaper or move it up; 5 s for an integration test or a QML case). The same report lands in `build/test-times.md`. Check it after adding costly tests.

**Where a test goes.** As low as it can: a rule over a whole range (every language, every order) is a unit test of the function; the layer above proves the wiring once, with one value from that range. A Python TestCase that starts a process or a server says `tier = "integration"` (on a base class it covers the subclasses); `scripts/pytests.py unit|integration [file ...]` runs one layer, and fails if a layer has no tests.

The Omarchy host's QML imports `qs.Commons`/`qs.Ui`, which only exist inside the Omarchy shell, so lint skips it; after changing it, `make restart` and read the log.

## Tests

**Rules go in the Rust core, views in QML.** Anything that decides something (which peek wins, how a key is edited, which pages show, what a module draws) is a function in `native/notchd-core` or a module in `native/notchd-modules`, with a Rust test next to it (`#[cfg(test)]`, or `tests/` of the crate for the ones that need a socket). QML binds the daemon's answers to the screen. A rule with a long table of cases (every language, every order) can keep it in `tests/vectors/rules/<name>.json`, which `native/notchd-core/tests/vectors.rs` runs (and Node runs the JS that is left, while it exists: `knownDiff` marks an accepted difference). Plain-JS files in `core/` are UI-side only (pixel geometry, control mechanics, the wire): plain functions and `var`s, which QML imports as is and `tests/load.mjs` evaluates in a Node vm, with a test in `tests/*.test.mjs`:

```js
import { test } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
import { load, plain } from './load.mjs';

const Config = load('core/Config.js');

test('valueAt follows dotted keys', () => {
  assert.equal(Config.valueAt({ theme: { accent: '#fff' } }, 'theme.accent'), '#fff');
});
```

Objects and arrays built inside the vm have their own prototypes; compare them through `plain()`.

**The protocol has fixtures.** `tests/protocol/` holds one JSON file per message (`to-ui/`, `to-daemon/`, `to-module/`, `from-module/`, `tree/`, `canvas/`, `provider/`, `manifest/`); `native/notchd-proto/tests/fixtures.rs` checks each parses and re-serializes byte-identically (canonical form), and `tests/qml/client.qml` runs the QML client against them through `tests/qml/fake-daemon.mjs`. A protocol change is a type in `notchd-proto`, a fixture and a line in `docs/architecture.md` together.

**A Rust test is hermetic.** `notchd-testkit` gives it a `TestEnv` (a temp dir holding the config, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and `HOME`, so the socket and every path are its own, removed when it drops), a `FakeUi` that connects, records `state`/`view` and sends `pointer`/`key`, and a fake module process. A daemon whose socket file is gone exits by itself, which is what keeps a failed test from leaving one behind; a test that starts the real binary still stops it.

**Tests are hermetic.** They never read or write `~/.config/notchd` or any real user path: the visual scenarios use a scratch dir, `make dev` uses `build/`. A test that needs a path gets it passed in. Detached daemons are the one thing that outlives a test: the QML and visual scripts put every daemon's socket in their scratch dir and kill whatever has `--socket <scratch>/` in its command line when they end. Offscreen renders also leave the desktop session alone: `scripts/isolated.sh` gives them a private D-Bus and runtime dir.

**For a bug fix, write the test first** and see it fail. Every bug found by hand gets one, even when the fix is a line: a Rust test when the bug is in a rule or a module, a QML behaviour test when it needs the QML runtime.

### QML behaviour tests

`tests/qml/shell.qml`, run by `make qmltest` (part of `make check`): cases that need real bindings, signals or animations, such as a list that stops being an `Array` after a `var` signal, or a height measured halfway through a transition. Each case is a function in the `cases` list that checks with `root.check(cond, why)` and ends with `root.done()`; `root.steps([[ms, fn], ...], last)` waits between steps, and `root.until(pred, fn)` waits for something to load (prefer it to a fixed wait: it costs only what it takes).

**Every service has a daemon.** The daemon owns the config, the settings schema, the notch state, every module and IPC, so a `NotchService` without one shows "notchd not running" and has no config. The tests create `TestService` (`tests/qml/TestService.qml`, which the scripts copy next to the `shell.qml` they run) instead: a `NotchService` that runs the real `notchd` (`make daemon`, `NOTCHD_TEST_DAEMON`) through the launcher's own path, on a socket in `NOTCHD_TEST_SOCKETS` and with its `configPath` as the daemon's config file. The scripts kill the daemons that are left (every one whose socket is in the scratch dir) when the run ends, and the cases start once each has answered (`daemonReady`). Edits reach the service at once but the daemon's schema and file a moment later: a case that reads either waits for it with `root.until`. `tests/qml/scenarios.qml` has the service start its daemon too. `NOTCHD_TEST_HOOKS=1` (set for the shell shards) gives the daemon `test-linger <ms>`, the guest windows' linger.

**Every case stands alone.** `scripts/qml-test.sh` runs the cases in parallel shards (`QMLTEST_JOBS`, default the CPUs up to 8), each its own Quickshell, longest first by the last run's times, so a case can run first, alone, or after any other. It sets up what it needs: `root.withTwoNotches(fn)` for the multi-notch service, `root.activate(keys)` for the window its keys go to. `QMLTEST_ONLY=<part of a name> make qmltest` runs just those cases; `QMLTEST_VERBOSE=1` lists the passes as well as the failures; `QMLTEST_KEEP=1` keeps the scratch dir (each shard's `log`, its configs and sockets). They run offscreen through `scripts/isolated.sh`, with the service's config in a scratch dir. For hover, clicks and drags, the `pointer` TestCase (QtTest, running no tests of its own) sends real pointer events to a card in a window: `pointer.mouseMove(item, x, y)`, `mousePress`, `mouseRelease`, `mouseClick`. Keys go to a TestCase's own window, so the `keys` TestCase sits inside the window of the card it types into: `keys.keyClick(Qt.Key_Escape)`. A test module the real hosts don't ship goes in `tests/qml/fixtures/`, loaded through a test service's `hostModules`. A case that guards a bug says which one in a comment.

**The scenarios** (`tests/qml/scenarios.qml`, one more shard of `make qmltest`, which builds the daemon first) run the real daemon and the QML service together: each scenario is a config, screens, module facts and a list of inputs (the pointer, a click, tabs, navigation keys, a drop, a peek), and after each `w.snap(label, expected)` the QML must show what `expected` says (a flat map of short texts: a notch's place, each copy's mode, pin, peek, tab, shown modules, `covered`, keyboard; the visitor; navigation). `NOTCHD_QMLTEST_RECORD=1` prints what each snapshot shows, for writing a new one: read it against the label before it goes in. `shell.qml` cases are written as flows (`root.go(function*() { ... yield root.settle(svc) ... })`): the daemon decides, so what a case does shows a round trip later, and `settle` waits for exactly that (the daemon answers a request after the state it made).

### Visual scenarios

`tests/visual/shell.qml` lists the scenarios: a page (`scrollTo`: `"end"` or pixels), a theme (dark or light), the host's fields; or an `edge`, which shows each module's view on that edge; or `down`, the row the notch shows while the daemon is away. Its services are `TestService`s, each with a daemon of its own (`make visual` builds the daemon, and so does `make hero`). Add one when a page, a control or a module's view changes, run `make visual` and look at the PNGs in `build/visual/`. They are not committed; a visual change gets before/after images in its PR or commit discussion.

### README image

`make hero` renders `docs/images/hero.webp` from `tests/visual/hero.qml`: the real `NotchCard` in four states, each with its own `NotchService` and demo data, offscreen. It runs on a private D-Bus where the only media player is `tests/visual/demo-player.py`, so whatever you are playing never ends up in the image, and with `tests/visual/bin` first on PATH, so the agents are demo scripts that print a finished conversation, never your own `claude` or `codex`, and their usage is set by hand (offscreen nothing asks the network). The tiles use Omarchy's Gruvbox colors and its "The Backwater" wallpaper (`WALLPAPER=<image> make hero` for another; a gradient without one). The wallpaper stays out of the repo; only the rendered image is committed. Rerun it after a visual change to the notch and commit the result.

### App icon

The icon is drawn by hand in `assets/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/notchd.svg`: the notch, with its shoulders, hanging from the top of a Gruvbox tile, holding an orange dot and an `n`. `make icons` renders it into `assets/icons/hicolor/<size>x<size>/apps/notchd.png` for every hicolor size from 16 to 1024 and into a multi-size `assets/icons/notchd.ico`. The tree is laid out like `/usr/share/icons/hicolor`, so a package can copy it as is. Edit the SVG, rerun `make icons` and commit the PNGs with it. `assets/icons/hicolor/symbolic/apps/notchd-symbolic.svg` is the same drawing in one color (a white tile with the notch knocked out), drawn by hand too: the Omarchy bar button tints it with the theme. Change it along with the SVG.

### Resource use

`make bench` measures what the notch costs: the standalone host on your real Wayland session, in a few scenarios (idle, a timer running, music playing; each closed and open), next to an empty Quickshell as the floor. Per scenario it samples CPU (% of one core), context switches per second (frames and timer wakeups show up here) and PSS/RSS from `/proc`, and writes the table to `build/bench.md` (`BENCH_SECONDS=20` for longer samples). A second notch shows on screen while it runs; keep the pointer away from it.

It can't run offscreen like the tests (`PanelWindow` needs a compositor, and rendering real frames is the cost that matters), so it runs on your display but on a private D-Bus that activates nothing, with the demo player as the only MPRIS player and a scratch config. It is not part of `make check`: the numbers depend on the machine and on what else runs. Run it before and after a change that could cost something, anything that animates, polls or adds a window, and put both tables in the commit discussion.

What keeps the cost down: anything that changes on screen makes its whole window render a frame, and every notch window covers its screen. A view that animates without pause (a `Behavior` that is always moving, a timer of a few hundred ms) renders at the monitor's refresh rate; drive it from one 60 fps `Timer` instead, never below 60 fps for something people watch. A copy that is hidden must not keep a live view. An `Image` without `mipmap: true` costs a texture atlas the size of the screen.

`manifest.json`'s `version` is the version, and `native/notchd-daemon/Cargo.toml`'s `version` is the same number (a unit test in `tests/fetch_daemon_test.py` fails when they differ): the plugin wants the daemon of its own version.

### Releasing

The plugin pins the daemon it downloads: `native/releases.json` (`{ "<version>": { "<target>": { "url", "sha256" } } }`) is the only source of checksums, changed only by a reviewed merge to main, so a tampered release asset fails the check. `scripts/fetch-daemon.py` reads it (see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#distribution)).

1. `make check`.
2. Bump `version` in `manifest.json` and in `native/notchd-daemon/Cargo.toml` (then `cargo build` to refresh `native/Cargo.lock`). Rename `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` to `[X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` and open a new empty one.
3. Commit as `vX.Y.Z`, tag it `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"`, push both. Tags are never moved.
4. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds `notchd` on an x86_64 and an aarch64 runner, uploads `notchd-X.Y.Z-<target>.tar.gz` and its `.sha256` to the GitHub release, and opens a PR on `release-pin-vX.Y.Z` adding the version to `native/releases.json`. Compare the hashes with the release's `.sha256` files and merge it. Until then the plugin on main answers "no release for this version". (Needs "Allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests" in the repo's Actions settings.)

`native/releases.json` is `{}` until the first release is tagged and its pin PR merged: until then a plugin install finds no daemon to download (`scripts/fetch-daemon.py` answers `no-release`), so on a machine that has not built one, run `make daemon` or `make restart` from a checkout.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `make rust`, `make test` and `make integration` on every push to main and every pull request.

### Documentation

A change updates the doc that describes it, in the same commit: `README.md` for users, `docs/` for reference, this file for workflow, `CLAUDE.md` for a new invariant. `grep` for the name you changed.
