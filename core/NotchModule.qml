import QtQuick

// Base type for every notch module. A module is a QML file whose root is a
// NotchModule: a built-in in core/modules/, or one a host ships (see
// NotchService.hostModules). List its id in the config's "modules" to load it.
//
// The notch shows, by state:
//   rest      nothing active: a small lip at its edge
//   compact   the highest-priority active module's `compact` view against
//             its edge (`verticalCompact` on a side edge, else a dot)
//   peek      a module's `peek` view (`verticalPeek` on a side edge, if it
//             has one), for a few seconds, after requestPeek()
//   expanded  on hover or click: the `expanded` view of every active module
//
// Views are Components so the notch can create them only while shown. They
// can refer to the module's own properties by its id. Views never rotate:
// on a side edge the notch runs down the edge for `verticalCompact` and
// `verticalPeek`, and grows sideways to hold the other views, which keep
// their layout. `notch.edge` and `notch.vertical` say where it is.

  // can't show then (open on another tab, say) shows as it closes. Its tab
  // shows a dot meanwhile. The module clears it once you have seen it.
